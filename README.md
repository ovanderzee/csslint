This is a fork. Here is the [origin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csslint)

### Changes

To me, it's mainly about the parser-lib with SVG support. I changed CSSLint to pick up my own version of [parser-lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parserlib)

Added functionality

*   [Dynamic classes are not overqualified](https://github.com/CSSLint/csslint/pull/613)
*   [The same overqualification can occur more than once ](https://github.com/CSSLint/csslint/pull/614)
